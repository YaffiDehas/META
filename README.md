Search Stores is  Web App that getting data from WS as json and display it in table. 
you can search stores in the table by filter: City, Address or free text.
The filtering in the json data was changed from the requirements caused the data was mismatched.
The regoin field was the city code - (it should be same for some cities)
So, I changed the filter like first filter city,
Then, you can filter address in this city (cause sometimes we have some stores in same address..)
