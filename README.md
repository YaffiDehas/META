Search Stores is  Web App that getting data from WS as json and display it in table. you can search stores in the table by filter: City, Address or free text.
The filtering in the json data was changed from the requirements caused the data was mismatched, the regoin field was the city code - (it should be same for some cities)
so, I changed the filter like first filter city then you can filter address in this city (cause sometimes we have some stores in same address..)
